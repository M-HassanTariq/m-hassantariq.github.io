    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Bird Bounce</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Hassan Tariq</p>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Bird Bounce is a single-player mobile game built using Unity.
        The game does not require account creation, login, or direct user identification.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
        Bird Bounce does not collect personal information directly from users.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the app uses third-party services that may automatically collect certain information
        for analytics, crash reporting, and advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, operating system version)</li>
        <li>App usage data (session duration, feature interactions)</li>
        <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers (where permitted by the user)</li>
        <li>General location data (country or region level)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Game progress data (such as coins, scores, or settings) is stored locally on the user's device
        and is not linked to any personal identity.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of Data Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve app performance and stability</li>
        <li>Analyze gameplay behavior to enhance user experience</li>
        <li>Detect and fix crashes and technical issues</li>
        <li>Display advertisements (personalized or non-personalized depending on user consent)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        Bird Bounce uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on your location and consent choice:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalized ads</strong> may be shown based on advertising identifiers and user interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-personalized ads</strong> may be shown based on contextual information such as app content or general location.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Users in regions where required (such as the European Economic Area, the UK, Switzerland,
        and certain US states) are presented with a consent or privacy choice message.
        Users may modify their preferences at any time via the in-app privacy settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Consent Management</h2>
    <p>
        The app uses Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to obtain and manage user consent
        where legally required.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users may accept, decline, or modify advertising preferences at any time using the
        privacy settings available within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Bird Bounce uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Firebase (analytics and crash reporting)</li>
        <li>Google AdMob (advertising services)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These services may collect and process information according to their own privacy policies.

        </a>
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        The developer does not sell, trade, or rent user data.
        Data is shared only with the third-party services listed above
        for analytics, crash reporting, and advertising functionality.

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Bird Bounce is designed for a general audience.
        The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where required by law, personalized advertising is disabled for users identified as children,
        and non-personalized ads are shown instead.
    </p>

    <h2>Regional Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data,
        including the right to access, delete, or restrict processing of data,
        or to opt out of personalized advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        These preferences can be managed through the in-app privacy settings
        or by contacting the developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to protect
        information processed by third-party services from unauthorized access or misuse.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
        Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
